/**
 * RGB LED / LED Strip Control
 *
 * Enable support for an RGB LED connected to 5V digital pins, or
 * an RGB Strip connected to MOSFETs controlled by digital pins.
 *
 * Adds the M150 command to set the LED (or LED strip) color.
 * If pins are PWM capable (e.g., 4, 5, 6, 11) then a range of
 * luminance values can be set from 0 to 255.
 * For NeoPixel LED an overall brightness parameter is also available.
 *
 *  === CAUTION ===
 *  LED Strips require a MOSFET Chip between PWM lines and LEDs,
 *  as the Arduino cannot handle the current the LEDs will require.
 *  Failure to follow this precaution can destroy your Arduino!
 *
 *  NOTE: A separate 5V power supply is required! The NeoPixel LED needs
 *  more current than the Arduino 5V linear regulator can produce.
 *
 *  Requires PWM frequency between 50 <> 100Hz (Check HAL or variant)
 *  Use FAST_PWM_FAN, if possible, to reduce fan noise.
